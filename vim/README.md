# vimrc
A simple config of vim without any plugins

# installation
windows
```
cd ~ & curl -O https://raw.githubusercontent.com/GopherJ/vimrc/master/_vimrc

/**
 * if you don't have curl in windows, please go to the url and copy it to ~/_vimrc
 */
```
linux
```
cd ~ & curl -O https://raw.githubusercontent.com/GopherJ/vimrc/master/.vimrc
```

# tutorial
All the shortcut is mapped to `normal` mode

```
- hs : split the screen horizontally
- vs : split the screen vertically
- ss : close  current screen

- ctrl + h => move cursor to the screen at left
- ctrl + l => move cursor to the screen at right
- ctrl + k => move cursor to the screen above
- ctrl + j => move cursor to the screen below

- ctrl + a => select all
- <F6>     => directory tree 
- <F3>     => close/open colorscheme

- ctrl + t     => new tab
- ctrl + w     => close current tab
- ctrl + left  => move to previous tab
- ctrl + right => movew to next tab 

- Left         => move to start of current line
- right        => move to end of current line

/**
 * Which means you have to be used to using h, j, k, l to move your cursor:)
 *
 * Tips:
 *   with this config file, system and vim use the same clipboard which means you can use
 *   ctrl + c in your system and then tape p in vim normal mode to paste.

```

I create this beacause pure vim is already powerful! I will update the config file over time.
